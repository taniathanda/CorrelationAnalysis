**Correlation Analysis**
Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables. It helps to understand whether an increase or decrease in one variable 
is associated with an increase or decrease in another.
**Types of Correlation**
1.	Positive Correlation (↑ ↑) – When one variable increases, the other also increases. 
    Example: Height and weight (taller people tend to weigh more).
2.	Negative Correlation (↑ ↓) – When one variable increases, the other decreases. 
    Example: Exercise and body fat (more exercise, lower body fat).
3.	No Correlation (0) – No relationship between variables. 
    Example: Shoe size and intelligence.
  	
**Correlation Coefficient (r)**
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is the most common measure, ranging from -1 to 1:
    •	+1 → Perfect positive correlation
    •	-1 → Perfect negative correlation
    •	0 → No correlation

This project file is to preprocess an NBA dataset, analyze the data, and understand the relationships between team salaries.
**Tasks**
1.	Load the Dataset
    - Loading the nba.csv file into a DataFrame.
      
2.	Data Preprocessing
    o	Removing any rows with missing information.
    o	Removing all duplicate rows.
    o	Shuffle the data and split it into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
  	
4.	Statistical Description
    o	Calculating and displaying the statistical description for both the training and test datasets.
  	
6.	Correlation Analysis
    o	Finding the correlation between the salaries of the following teams:
    	Boston Celtics
    	Brooklyn Nets
    	New York Knicks
